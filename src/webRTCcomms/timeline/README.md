## About
WebRTC is bandwidth expensive and hard to decentralize, particularly for large rooms.<br>

Enter our _p2p-walkie-talkie_ rendered over a _timeline_ playing linearly _(like a conference)_ and able to <br>
_rewind/forward_ like a _podcast_ supporting audio or speech-to-text messages syncronized in realtime.

## Demo

Exciting? Confusing? _Try out the [LIVE DEMO](https://audiotimeline.glitch.me/) with a friend, or two ...  or a hundred!_
